      <p> I am Erica N. Fabito. I am currently living in Poblacion Sual, Pangasinan and I'm 21 years old. I was born on July 7, 2000 iinAlaminos City Pangasinan. I'm the eldest in a brood of three, and I'm taking a BS Math major in CIT at Pangasinan State University, Lingayen Campus.<br><bbrI grew up under the supervision of my parents. I have two younger siblings all of us were females. I love drawing, photography and cycling. I also love wearing boyish outfits. I'm a shy-type person for I won't say a word unless you do the talking first. However, I still got a circle of friends. I studied at <a href ="http://localhost:8158/Second%20screen.html">Sual Central School</a> when I was a kid. I had a lot of friends there, and I graduated from <a href ="http://localhost:8158/Third%20screen.html">Sual National High School</a>.<br><br>A thing that reflects myself is an empty cup. I'm the type of person whose willing to be trained and like an empty cup, I always consider myself as a "newbie" to acquire new learnings and use those for self development in order to become a better version of myself.</p>
